        <br><br> Other than my day job, I also am a Scout Leader, working with youth training for Scout Chiefs.
        <br><br>Which means basically <s>playing around in the nature</s> enabling young leaders to create pedagogical activities so they can keep creating a world where kids are empowered to become <i>self-fulfilled as individuals and play a constructive role in society</i>
        <br>(Check out the <a href="https://www.scout.org/"> Scout Mission  </a> for more).

        <br>When I'm not at it, I like to sit on my piano, cook and hang out with friends, or read.

        <b>I happen to have a favorite quote about engineering:
